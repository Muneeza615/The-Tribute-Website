                <h2>Father of Pakistan's Nuclear Program</h2>
                <p><b>Abdul Qadeer Khan</b> (born April 1, 1936, Bhopal, India—died October 10, 2021, Islamabad,
                    Pakistan) was a Pakistani engineer, a <b>key figure in Pakistan’s nuclear weapons program</b> who
                    was also involved for
                    decades in a black market of nuclear technology and know-how whereby uranium-enrichment centrifuges,
                    nuclear warhead designs, missiles, and expertise were sold or traded to Iran, North Korea, Libya,
                    and possibly other countries.In 1947, during Khan’s childhood, India achieved independence from
                    Britain, and <b>Muslim areas in the east and west</b> were partitioned to form the state of
                    Pakistan. Khan immigrated to West Pakistan in
                    1952, and in 1960 he graduated from the University of Karachi with a degree in metallurgy. Over the
                    next decade he pursued graduate studies abroad, first in <b>West Berlin and then in Delft</b>,
                    Netherlands,
                    where in 1967 he received a master’s degree in metallurgy.
